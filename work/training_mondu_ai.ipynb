    "The above transformation is directly against the train set. The target variable **default_flag** and other variables were derived from the above transformation of the train set. \n",

Hence, buyers with accepted orders who paid within the approved period of 5 days after due date and with a payment rate of 50% and above were classified as non-default buyers. In this case, these buyers has a default_flag of 'N'.  Buyers who didn't pay within the approved period of 5 days after due date  and with payment rate less than 50% are classified as defaulting. These buyers has a default_flag of 'Y'.\n",

    "2. **buyer_recency**: This is simply how recent a buyer has taken an order from the latest order date in the data set. Recency from research is a good predictor of delinquency. Also, in this case it is a way to measure buyers-to-merchant loyalty which is typical to BNPL. Recency here is measured in days.\n",

    "3. **frequency**: This is how often a buyer transact or accept order from the merchant. It's not a count of orders rather the frequency in days of buyers orders. A buyer who transacted once even with a large monetary value cannot be said to be more loyal when compared with a buyer who transact every now and then with a good monetary value. It is also a measure of loyalty.\n",

    "4. **buyer_acceptance_rate / buyer_rejection_rate**: It's simply the number of accepted orders devided by the total number of orders and vice-versa. This features are not very useful in our case because every buyer in the dataset either had an accepted order or rejected order. In a real-life scenario where cross-selling between merchants is prevalent, these features are good predictors of delinquency.\n",
